download sitemaps from https://hercules-merchandise.co.uk/, https://hercules-merchandise.de/ and https://hercules-merchandising.fr/ to ./downloads in a respective folder

extract url for each product for each locale specific site

update link tags with hreflang url properly on this astro site where required based on the local and the url you already extracted

this should happen on every page where hreflang is mentioned

first show step by step actions you are going to perform

all temp files that get downloads should be saved in the same folder as where this file is (create required folders if needed)

make sure we might need to revert if not properly done

then execute
